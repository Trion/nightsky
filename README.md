# Nightsky
Nightsky is a easy programmable 6x5 LED-matrix.
It’s just a sample project, so the code is pretty specialized.

## Hardware
The device consists of 30 white LEDs, two 74HC595N shift registers and some silvered wire.
The animations are driven by an Arduino Uno board.

### Build instructions
TBD

## Software requirements

For the firmware you need:
* [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) (or just the driver)
* [Arduino-mk](https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile) (optional, if you don’t like the IDE)

The client needs the following libraries:
* [Qt5](http://qt-project.org/)
* [pySerial](http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/)
* [PyQt5](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/)
